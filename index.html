		<h1>ALL SERVERS HOSTED AT QUAKE.CSH.RIT.EDU</h1>
		<p>
			Since November 2025, RIT's Computer Science House has been hosting 24/7 Quake servers. We run Deathmatch, Team DM, Capture the Flag, and other game modes. Our servers are open to the public and we host LAN parties semi-regularly.
		</p>
		<p>
			All servers are maintained by Nick Gilbert, a member of CSH. If you have any questions, suggestions, or issues, please don't hesitate to contact him at <a href="mailto:paradox@csh.rit.edu">paradox@csh.rit.edu</a>.
		</p>
		<h1>SERVERS</h1>
		<h2>Quake 1 (NetQuake)</h2>
		<h3>
			quake.csh.rit.edu:26000
		</h3>
		<p>
			Mostly vanilla Quake 1 server using the NetQuake protocol on QSS-M software, running a few game modes:
			<ul>
				<li>Deathmatch (DM)</li>
				<li>Team Deathmatch (TDM)</li>
				<li>Capture the Flag (CTF)</li>
			</ul>
			Requires Threewave CTF for Capture the Flag, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/threewave-capture/downloads/threewave-ctf-for-quake-full-pack">ModDB</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Best for local play at RIT. Frag limit 20 and no time limit. Runs vanilla maps for DM/TDM and base Threewave maps for CTF. Will support spectator mode soon.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Recommended clients:
		</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://qssm.quakeone.com/">QSS-M</a>, the leading NetQuake port for Windows, Mac, and Linux</li>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/andrei-drexler/ironwail">Ironwail</a>, a modern high-performance port for Windows and Linux</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.quakeone.com/markv/">Mark V</a>, an older port with a software renderer for Windows, Mac, and Linux</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h2>Quake 1 (QuakeWorld)</h2>
		<h3>
			quake.csh.rit.edu:27500
		</h3>
		<p>
			Work-in-progress Quake 1 server using the QuakeWorld protocol on MVDSV software, running Deathmatch only at the moment.
		</p>
		<p>
			Much better netcode for long-distance play, but also features different physics compared to NetQuake. Frag limit 20 and no time limit. Runs vanilla maps. Currently doesn't have CTF, an MotD, or increased axe damage from the NetQuake server, but these will be added soon.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Recommended clients:
		</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://qssm.quakeone.com/">ezQuake</a>, the leading QuakeWorld port for Windows, Mac, and Linux</li>
				<li>ezQuake is the only client worth using for QuakeWorld</li>
				<li>If you plan on playing other QuakeWorld servers, nQuake will help you jumpstart your configuration, but it isn't required for Quake @ CSH</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h2>Future</h2>
		<p>
			These aren't set up yet, but are planned for the near future:
			<ul>
				<li>Quake Team Fortress</li>
				<li>Quake 2</li>
				<li>Quake 3</li>
				<li>Quake Live</li>
			</ul>
